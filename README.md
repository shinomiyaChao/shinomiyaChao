Sister, tonight I’m in Delhi, where the night encompasses me
Sister, tonight, at the end of the grassland, I have nothing 
but the desert, empty-handed,
can’t even hold a tear when sorrow hits
Sister, tonight I’m in Delhi,
an obsolete city in the rain,
for the passing-by and the settling-down.
Delhi, tonight,
This is the only, and the last expression.
This is the only, and the last grassland.
I give the rock back to the rocks
And victory back to the victorious.
Tonight, the barley belongs to only himself,
And everything grows.
Tonight, I only have the beauty of the desert, so empty.
Sister, tonight I don’t care about humanity, I only think of you.
